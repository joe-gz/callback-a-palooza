# Callback Mini-Lab

This lab is an opportunity to apply your leveled-up Javascript skills to a series of challenges. It is also an opportunity to practice [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET3Q6zNK3Io&ab_channel=AgileAcademyAus) and [test driven development](http://luizricardo.org/wordpress/wp-content/upload-files/2014/05/tdd_flow.gif), two common Agile practices. We'll be talking more about Agile Methodologies later this week, so consider this lab a bit of a preview...

The instructions for each challenge are included in the script.js file. You can test your solutions by running node in your terminal. Simply make sure you are inside of your callback-a-palooza directory, then run `node tests.js`.
